# Algorithms

Several popular algorithms that I've implemented while studying various computer science courses. 

These include:

* Recursive Dec to Hex Conversion (python)
* Karatsuba Multiplication (matlab)
* Inversion Counting (python)
* QuickSort (python)
* Karger's Contraction for Min Cut (python)
